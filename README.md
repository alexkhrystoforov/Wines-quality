 Exploring Wine quality
 
 A winery wants to optimize their business and improve quality assurance by DS&ML solution. The ultimate goal is to fire all sommeliers and replace them by a series of chemical tests. Currently sommeliers marks are used for wine marketing and distribution to distinguish elite wines out of average and poor ones regardless of region and year of production.
